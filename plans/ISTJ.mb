Powered Marketing Plan — The Analyst Agent (ISTJ)

⸻

🧠 1. Psychological Profile & Core Insight

The ISTJ Realtor Archetype: The Analyst Agent is a dependable, detail-oriented professional. Known for their calm confidence and thorough approach, ISTJs are the “steady closers” who win trust through precision, transparency, and follow-through — not big showmanship.

Psychological Edge:
	•	Steadfast Advisor: You’re the Realtor clients trust with the fine print. Contracts, timelines, inspection reports — you catch what others miss.
	•	Reputation-Driven: Your brand grows through word-of-mouth. Clients come back because you make the process predictable and drama-free.
	•	Calm Command: When surprises happen, you stay cool. This steadiness appeals to buyers who want no surprises — military families, corporate transferees, older repeat buyers.

Market Fit:
	•	Steady, repeat buyers — military families, corporate relocations, detail-focused retirees.
	•	Established, stable neighborhoods where trust and consistency win more than flash.
